# pizzeria-maria

Back-end application to process and store information on pizzas and orders.

Let's help Aunt Maria to catch up with the competition by building a serverless API for her pizzeria.

Aunt Maria already has a website, so you will build a back-end applicationmore precisely, an APIâ€”to enable her customers to preview and order pizzas.
The API will be responsible for serving pizza and order information, as well as handling pizza orders. Later, we will add a mobile application, which would
consume the API services.

We will use the following technologies:

- adding routes to the API;

- deploying it to AWS Lambda using Claudia (https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/FAQ.md);
- to persist and deliver all orders;
- connecting the API to the DynamoDB table;
- communicate the API with a third-party service using webhooks;
- debug serverless application;
- authenticate and authorize users;
- images manipulation;
- using minimal-request-promise
  Note: aws access key and secret key will not be exposed here.

Because we are using AWS, these are the building blocks for serverless aws applications:

- Lambda is used for computing, it contains the business logic of the application.
- API Gateway is a router that accepts HTTP requests and invokes other services
  depending on the routes.
- DynamoDB is an autoscalable database.
- Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage service that abstracts the standard hard
  drives and offers you unlimited storage.

Lambda is the main piece of the application.
AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform that allows you to
run functions.

First API endpoints
Here is the list of features for the initial API that will be created in a single Lambda function:

- Listing all pizzas;
- Retrieving the pizza orders;
- Creating a pizza order;
- Updating a pizza order;
- Canceling a pizza order;
  Each feature will have their own route to the corresponding handler.

NPM packages to install:
aws-sdk
claudia
claudia-api-builder
claudia-bot-builder

To create the right user policy from the aws CLI:
\$ aws iam put-role-policy --role-name pizzeriamaria-executor --policy-name PizzaMariaApiDynamoDB --policy-document file://./roles/dynamodb.json

To scan the table:
\$aws dynamodb scan --table-name pizza-orders --region us-east-2 --output json

A serverless application must be able to connect to:

- A database (DynamoDB, Amazon RDS)
- Another Lambda function
- Another AWS service (SQS, S3, and many others)
- An external API

A webhook is just an endpoint on your API. Simply put, it is an HTTP callback: an HTTP POST request sent to you when something happens. You can think of it as a simple event notification via HTTP POST. A web application implementing webhooks will POST a message to a URL when certain events happen.
