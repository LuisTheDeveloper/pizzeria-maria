# pizzeria-maria

Back-end application to processand store information on pizzas and orders.

Let's help Aunt Maria to catch up with the competition by building a serverless API for her pizzeria. 

We will use the following technologies:
- adding routes to the API;
- deploying it to AWS Lambda using Claudia; 
- to persist and deliver all orders; 
- connecting the API to the DynamoDB table;
- communicate the API with a third-party service;

Note: aws access key and secret key will not be exposed here.
