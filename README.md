# pizzeria-maria

Back-end application to processand store information on pizzas and orders.

Let's help Aunt Maria to catch up with the competition by building a serverless API for her pizzeria.
Aunt Maria already has a website, so you will build a back-end applicationmore precisely, an APIâ€”to enable her customers to preview and order pizzas.
The API will be responsible for serving pizza and order information, as well as handling pizza orders. Later, we will add a mobile application, which would
consume the API services.

We will use the following technologies:

- adding routes to the API;
- deploying it to AWS Lambda using Claudia (https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/FAQ.md);
- to persist and deliver all orders;
- connecting the API to the DynamoDB table;
- communicate the API with a third-party service;

Note: aws access key and secret key will not be exposed here.

Because we are using AWS, these are the building blocks for serverless aws applications:

- Lambda is used for computing, it contains the business logic of the application.
- API Gateway is a router that accepts HTTP requests and invokes other services
  depending on the routes.
- DynamoDB is an autoscalable database.
- Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage service that abstracts the standard hard
  drives and offers you unlimited storage.

Lambda is the main piece of the application.
AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform that allows you to
run functions.

First API endpoints
Here is the list of features for the initial API that will be created in a single Lambda function:

- Listing all pizzas;
- Retrieving the pizza orders;
- Creating a pizza order;
- Updating a pizza order;
- Canceling a pizza order;
  Each feature will have their own route to the corresponding handler.
